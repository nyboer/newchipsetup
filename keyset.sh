# get CHIP on your network
# make a key on your local computer:
#   ssh-keygen -t rsa
# Copy this key and scripts to C.H.I.P.â€™s root directory with scp:
#   scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub keyset.sh rename.sh rename_input.sh chip@chip.local:~/
# SSH into chip, for example:
#   ssh chip@chip.local
# then run 
#   ./rename.sh <newname> 
# and 
#   ./keyset.sh
# on CHIP
# you can also use 
#   ./rename_input.sh
# which simply prompts you for a name
